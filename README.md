# Projet C++, S\L bacteria. 
##Introduction
Our goal is to compute experiences led by Ribeck, N. & Lenski, R.E. (2015) to plot phase portrait between GA and GB populations, depending on two specific parameters T and Ainit which are respectivly the number of times the environmental concentrations are reset and a quantity of metabolit A introduced in each cell of the W*H grid. 

The goal is to plot the corresponding heatmap at the end of the simulation : plotting A_init on the bottom and T_ on the right
